        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case sensitive</li>
          <li>An HMTL attribute defines additional inormation about an element</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metada about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for search engine optimization (SEO)</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user</li>
          <li>The elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children elements are known as the parent element</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text</li>
          <li>The img element contains informations about images that are displayed on the webpage</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location, or source of the image</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The ul element contains an unordered, or bullet list</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the link document resource</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation</li>
          <li>We can use semantic HTLM elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section"> 
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector</li>
        </ul>
