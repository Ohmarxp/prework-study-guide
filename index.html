        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          
          <li>HTML is one of the three cornerstone languages used in web development.</li>
          <li>HTML is used to create the structure of a webpage.</li>
          <li>An element is a type of content on a webpage.</li>
          <li>Declarations are not case sensitive.</li>
          <li>An HMTL attribute defines additional inormation about an element.</li>
          <li>The head element contains information, or metada about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The style element defines the CSS styles associated with a website.</li>
          <li>The base element defines the base URL for a webpage.</li>
          <li>The link element connects an external resource to the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The meta element defines metadata such as the character set, description, keywords, author, and viewport.</li>
          <li>The script element embeds client-side scripts in the HTML document.</li>
          <li>The title element defines the title for a webpage. This element is required and is extremely important for search engine optimization (SEO).</li>
          <li>Metadata is data about our webpage that the browser uses to effectively serve our webpage to users.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>The elements that are nested inside other elements are called child elements.</li>
          <li>The element that holds all the children elements are known as the parent element.</li>
          <li>The h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, and h6 elements represent the level of heading a given text block represents.</li>
          <li>The p element represents a paragraph or block of text.</li>
          <li>The img element contains informations about images that are displayed on the webpage.</li>
          <li>The src attribute is the most important because it defines the location, or source of the image.</li>
          <li>The ul, ol, and li elements represent unordered lists, ordered lists, and list items.</li>
          <li>The ul element contains an unordered, or bullet list.</li>
          <li>The br element creates a line of empty space, or a line break, between two blocks of content.</li>
          <li>The a element (which stands for anchor) creates links to the same webpage or other webpages.</li>
          <li>The rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the link document resource.</li>
          <li>The href attribute points to the URL for the link.</li>
          <li>The footer element appears at the bottom of the page and usually contains the author, copyright, contact, sitemap, and navigation.</li>
          <li>We can use semantic HTLM elements to indicate the role of their content, as well as to give structure to the content of the webpage.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="css-section"> 
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>CSS is a programming language used by developers to define how webpage content is presented to users.</li>
          <li>Inline CSS is used when a developer wants to style an element directly in the HTML file.</li>
          <li>Internal style sheet contains CSS rules for the webpage in the head section of the HTML file.</li>
          <li>External CSS style sheet is preferred in most cases because it allows developers to keep all their CSS rules in a separate file, which makes design changes easier.</li>
          <li>Separation of concerns is a widely used term in web development and refers to separating code into different files based on use.</li>
          <li>Declarations contain two important components: the CSS property we want to apply and the value of the property.</li>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>We can combine two selectors into a single CSS rule with a comma, allowing the declarations to affect both selectors.</li>
          <li>Sometimes, we want to apply a rule to all the elements visible on the page. To do that, we use a special wild card symbol, or *.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
          <li>The period preceding card designates this as a class selector. Any HTML element assigned to the class, card, will gain these property assignments from the CSS.</li>
          <li>We can style HTML elements using the elements as selectors or by using the class attribute as a selector.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="git-section"> 
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on.</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section"> 
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that can add interactivity to a website.</li>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>Typically, JavaScript code is executed from top to bottom. However, using conditional statements such as if statements allows us to interrupt control flow.</li>
          <li>When creating an if statement, we provide one or more conditions for the computer to evaluate.</li>
          <li>If one condition is truthy, the computer will execute the code that we provide between curly brackets.</li>
          <li>If the condition is not truthy, the code will not execute, interrupting the control flow.</li>
          <li>Interrupting the control flow in this way allows us to build apps that respond to a user's actions.</li>
          <li>A for loop uses the predictable pattern of indices to perform a task on all the items in an array by allowing a single code block to be executed over and over. </li>
          <li>An array is a single variable that is used to hold a group of data.</li>
          <li>Arrays are especially useful when we want to perform a task on multiple pieces of data at once.</li>
          <li>A single array can store different types of data, such as strings, numbers, and so on.</li>
          <li>In JavaScript and many other programming languages, arrays are zero-indexed and sequential. </li>
          <li>At the most basic level, a function is simply a set of instructions that tells the computer how to perform a certain task.</li>
          <li>When we create a function, we are defining a block of code that performs a specific task and giving it a unique name.</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file is run.</li>
          <li>To execute a function, we must call it in our code.</li>
          <li>Math is a built-in object that has properties and methods for mathematical constants and functions. It's not a function object.</li>
